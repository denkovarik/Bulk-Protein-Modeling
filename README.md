# Bulk-Protein-Modeling

## Introduction
Protein modeling is the process of attempting to determine a proteins 3D structure by using its amino acid sequence. Determining a proteins 3D structure manually through experimentation can take years and isn't even guaranteed to be successful. Luckily, there are software tools available to help researcheres predict the structure of a target protein within a reaonable amount of time. One such tool is [MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller/). This software uses a template protein to attempt to predict the structure of a target protein. In addition, the [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) software can be used to help choose a template protein for the protein being modeled.
